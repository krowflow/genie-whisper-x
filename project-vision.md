üöÄ Project Vision: Genie Whisper X
Mission Statement
To create a robust, modular, and truly local-first AI voice agent that acts as your operational co-pilot‚Äîcapable of listening, acting, remembering, and adapting‚Äîin real time, without cloud dependencies. Genie Whisper X is the evolution of digital assistance: privacy-first, API-optional, and extensible by design.

Core Principles
Local-First: All speech, processing, and actions run offline by default.

Modular Architecture: Each subsystem (VAD, STT, TTS, NLU, Action, UI) is an isolated, replaceable module‚Äîno monolithic bloat.

API-Optional: OpenAI/GPT calls are available on demand, never required. You control when to use cloud power.

Real-Time Transparency: The UI shows, in real time, which agent modules are active, what actions are being taken, and system memory/state.

Agent, Not a Bot: Genie Whisper X doesn‚Äôt just transcribe‚Äîit listens, remembers, acts, and reports. It‚Äôs a field agent, not a toy.

Strategic Goals
Operational Autonomy:
Genie Whisper X functions as a local field agent. It can transcribe, parse intent, act (e.g., open apps, read files, automate tasks), and speak‚Äîall offline.

Full-Duplex Voice Control:
System supports wake word, real-time STT, and TTS, allowing you to interrupt, command, and receive spoken feedback instantly.

Visual Command and Control:
All agent activity is visible in real time:

Waveforms

Command/status widgets

Memory/context tray

Tool/action popups

Security and Privacy:

No microphone or network use unless explicitly authorized.

All models and data run and are stored locally.

API keys are never exposed or auto-used.

Rapid Extensibility:

Plug in new modules: browser agents, file readers, home automation, etc.

Update or replace any subsystem without breaking the core.

End State: What Success Looks Like
You launch Genie Whisper X.

UI shows agent status, waveform, memory, and tool consoles.

You say: ‚ÄúHey Genie, open Notepad.‚Äù
‚Üí Genie wakes, logs command, executes, and responds: ‚ÄúOpening Notepad.‚Äù

All logs, memory, and context are accessible for review.

If you flip the ‚ÄúCloud API‚Äù toggle, Genie uses OpenAI for complex intent or coding help.

Agent survives full offline operation and works across Windows, Mac, and Linux.
